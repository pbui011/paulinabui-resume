        <div class="subheading mb-5">English and PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Paulina Bui, or Lin for short, and I am a freshman at UCR, looking to major in English and Psychology. My current goals include studying abroad for a year in Japan or Europe once I am an upperclassman and going to law school or graduate school upon completing my bachelorâ€™s at UCR. I am aspiring to become an investigative lawyer, family lawyer, or psychologist, as my main goal is to help others in their lives and ultimately make the world a better place. I have also briefly considered adding a business minor to my studies, though I am undecided in the additional education. However, whatever helps me achieve my goal of helping others and making a change â€” whether it be someoneâ€™s life or an action that inadvertently adjusts anotherâ€™s path to go in a more positive direction â€” I am hoping to do whatever it takes to achieve that final goal. Because I have been helped constantly, by so many people in my life: friends, family, strangers, acquaintances, I feel the desire to pay it forward, to give another good deed to someone else.
 <br><br>

        In my spare time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, such as reading fiction, writing stories for pleasure, playing piano, listening to music, connecting with others, and exploring other cultures through media and entertainment. Iâ€™ve been writing fiction for as long as I can remember, and it has become something of a breather activity whenever I need a break from life or have personal time to myself. Additionally, I extend to my friends whenever I feel as though I need a good laugh and a reminder that the world is good and I can be happy. Sitting outside, feeling the night air against my skin, and our laughter twining like smoke into the stars as we gorge on ice cream and cajun french fries becomes one of those cathartic moments that I look back on fondly. Though most people would describe their ideal night to be wild, exciting â€” essentially a once in a lifetime experience â€” Iâ€™ve grown to realize that my ideal nights and days are spent in good company, with a good talk about nothing in particular, and good food that we all love and enjoy. That is comfort for me, that is something Iâ€™ve found myself enjoying time and time again.
<br><br>

        I intend for my hobbies and interests to coincide with my preferred profession: in learning so many hobbies, and helping create and design so many things, I hope to help someone discover their own passions for escapism, as these have helped me throughout the years. As I have come to rely on my passions to assist me through life, I want to help someone else discover their artistic passion for life as well. I believe it is something completely necessary in everyoneâ€™s life, and whether Iâ€™d be helping a couple find ways to cope with their separate lives, or helping a child find a new hobby, I hope to help change their lives in just the smallest steps.
